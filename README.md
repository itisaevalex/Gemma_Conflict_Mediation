AI Mediation Assistant

An innovative peer mediation application leveraging Gemma LLM to resolve interpersonal conflicts through AI-driven dialogue. Built for the Gemma Lablab Hackathon, this project demonstrates how AI can foster constructive communication and conflict resolution in real-time.
Overview

The AI Mediation Assistant facilitates structured conversations between two parties in conflict. With Gemma LLM as the mediator, the application ensures both parties are heard, acknowledged, and guided toward resolution in a neutral, supportive environment.

How It Works

    Mediation Case Creation:
        Users initiate a mediation session by identifying themselves and the other party.
        Each participant receives a unique session code to join the mediation.

    Structured Conversation Flow:
        Party 1: Raises the concern and describes the issue.
        Party 2: Responds to the concern and shares their perspective.
        Mediator: Guides the conversation with empathetic and constructive prompts.

    Conflict Resolution:
        Through guided dialogue, parties gain clarity and work toward a resolution.
